Two months ago my first baby was born. We had educated ourselves a lot with my partner, and were prepared for delivering her with all the love that we could. We searched for a medical team that supported what we believed was correct in this process (to welcome her in an environment of love), and what ended up happening posed a big trauma in the lives of the three of us. It ended up being a nightmare, and a big part of what happened was because of the mindset of the medical team that we trusted for this process.

I'm creating this project so that people like us can share their experience with different healthcare professionals with the internet, and with that help parents that will come later to know who they are dealing with, and how they do things. It would have been of huge value for the two of us to have information about our medical team before we decided to have our birth with them. This project is an answer to that.
